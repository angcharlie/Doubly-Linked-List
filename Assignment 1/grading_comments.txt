Well done!

-1 The default constructor should set tail = NULL (like head).  The copy constructor
 should set tail = NULL when copying from an empty list. 

Minor: in reverse, it is a good idea (a good habit) to explicitly set end = NULL before reverse returns.
 copy should still be deleted (i.e., this is not a memory leak) since its destructor should be
 invoked when reverse ends.

Textbook exercises correct (one minor error).
